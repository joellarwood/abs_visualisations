## Proof of concept for a Infomation Tile giving key Inidicator 

## The idea here is that conceptually linked data (i.e. economic indicators, population) can be shown
## at a high level with key information provided in a tile that provides a link to the publication if more 
## information is needed. This is a step up from the current functionality of the key economic indicators 
## page on the ABS website and would present the same information in a more visually captivating way. 
## Similarities can also be drawn with the US census bureau https://www.census.gov/economic-indicators/

## Much of this code and the ideas behind the presentation come from J. Kunst https://jbkunst.shinyapps.io/trd-sttstcs
## and https://jkunst.com/blog/posts/2020-06-26-valuebox-and-sparklines/
